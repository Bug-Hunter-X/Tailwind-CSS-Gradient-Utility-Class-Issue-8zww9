```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">
  </div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS's `bg-gradient-to-r` utility class to create a linear gradient from blue to purple. However, if you are using an older version of Tailwind CSS or have not configured your project correctly, this might not work as expected.

The issue is that older versions of Tailwind might not support gradient utilities or may require different syntax. Also, you might have issues if your Tailwind config is not set up correctly, leading to missing or incorrect styles.

Another potential issue is that gradient utilities can sometimes conflict with other Tailwind classes, causing unexpected visual results. Make sure you're not combining gradient utilities with styles that might interfere.
