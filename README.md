# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradient utility classes in older versions or with misconfigurations. The problem arises when attempting to use gradient utility classes such as `bg-gradient-to-r` without proper setup or when encountering conflicts with other styles.

## Bug Description:

The code uses `bg-gradient-to-r` to create a linear gradient. However, this might not render correctly in older versions of Tailwind CSS or with incorrect configuration. Conflicts with other styles can also cause unexpected behavior.

## Solution:

Ensure that you are using a recent, compatible version of Tailwind CSS. Verify that your `tailwind.config.js` is correctly configured and that the `theme` section includes the necessary gradient configuration.  Resolve any conflicts with other style classes.
